# Automatic-Ticket-Classification-using-NLP
This is the Capstone Project I did as part of my Data Science Course.
# Problem Statement
Cluster the complaints received by a financial institution in to 5 categories. Create a model that can classify the tickets automatically which will help route the complaint to appropriate department and resolve it faster.

# Process and Techniques used 
Exploratory Data Analysis
Text Processing
Clustering
Word Cloud Visualisation
Test Train Split the Data
Vectorization - Count Vectorizer and TFID Transformer
Apply Standard Scaler and Dimensionality Reduction
Modelling And Evaluation
Conclusion
